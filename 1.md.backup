## LeetCode 1

Use dictionary to store both index and data.

My solution:

```python
def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        dic = {}
        
        for index in range(len(nums)):
            x = nums[index]
            if target - x in dic:
                return [dic[target - x], index]
            
            dic[x] = index
```

This question is a easy one but the usage of dictionary is interesting and useful.
